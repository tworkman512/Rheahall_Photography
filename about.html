	      		<h3>What People Are Saying...</h3>
	      		<blockquote>"Rhea took my maternity photos this January, and they came out absolutely beautiful. I was so impressed with her overall patience and professionalism during the photo shoot. She was amazing and we had so much fun during the whole process! We visited two beautiful locations and she was so knowledgeable about the best lighting and most complimenting poses! I can't wait to refer her to friends and family, because I know I will be referring an amazing photographer who will not disappoint! Thank you so much for capturing this special milestone in our lives and helping us celebrate the upcoming birth of our son!!"
				<b>- I.Chong</b></blockquote>
				<blockquote>"Rhea doesn't just take photos, she captures beautiful moments. I have worked with her on two occasions and she was on time, patient and lovely to work with. She took photos of my baby girl and my family reunion. I was very impressed how she was able to handle a big group of people and make us all look our best. She is our family photographer and I highly recommend Rhea as your photographer."
				<b>- R.Ontiveros</b></blockquote>
				<blockquote>"Lets' start from a point of view Rhea Hall can see that nobody imagines until the moment is captured in time..giving the mind a tickle and the body a touch of what life is like in that still photograph.
				The Romantic - may it be obvious or subtle - artistic eye a photographer may have, does not always capture a lifetime with a blink of an eye or snap of a camera.
				An adventure is in each picture. Whatever you want to see, Rhea's photography will reveal. The message you want to cast will even be seen by the average Joe.  
				It's a feeling, not a photograph."
